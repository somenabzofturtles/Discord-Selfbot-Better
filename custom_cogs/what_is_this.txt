Hello! Seems like you ran into this folder and don't know what this is for. This folder is meant to hold various custom cogs you can download.

Custom cogs are additional add-ons you can download for the bot which will usually come with additional features and commands.

For more info on what they are, how they can be accessed and downloaded, and how you can make one too, go here: https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot/wiki/Other-Add-ons
